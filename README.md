## 🌍 What We're Building

Chemical manufacturers around the world waste millions in excess material disposal due to lack of digital infrastructure and market access. We’re solving this with:

- A **smart B2B marketplace** for surplus chemicals and materials  
- Direct **SAP & ERP integration** for seamless inventory syncing  
- **AI-driven matching & classification**, based on product specs and industry metadata  
- A scalable, secure, modular architecture designed for real industry use

> Think: if Alibaba, SAP, and Clariant built something truly circular together.
